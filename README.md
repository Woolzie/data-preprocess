## day 1
attempted to run this project by copying the code 
https://github.com/keitazoumana/LLMs/blob/main/Extract_Metadata_With_Large_Language_Models_V2.ipynb

didnt work due to issues in the library code

## day 2

created main.py in the current repo, processed the text and experimneted with data structures (tried to convert json using stack, doesnt work)

understood bbox and made an importance list that denotes a weighted average of font-weight and font-size 

goal was to include the words and the importance list and the bbox value list and have headings and subheadings be infered from the importance list and have tables be infered from the bbox list

- the " stack" implementation was done to convert simple normal pdfs with not tables (including the bordered ones) but the code got too messy and doesnt fit with the goal of the project 

## day 3
checked out other articles and researched on the models used especially the ones that will take the values mentioned above
models yet to try but found promising articles 

models in mind - LayoutLMV3, donut, tablenet
